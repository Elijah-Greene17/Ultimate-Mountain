# Ultimate-Mountain

2/7/2025

The purpose of this project is to showcase my work in C# and .NET as well as introduce myself to .NET MAUI.

My current plan is to create a Web App that allows users to search for and view information about mountains, search for peak-bagging challenges, as well as have them track said challenges.

I'd like to structure the backend of this application as a Molonith type, but I'm curious to explore how easy it would be to convert to a Microservice architecture later down the road.

Anticipated Tech Stack:
- .NET MAUI (WASM Front-end)
- .NET Core with C#
- Unknown Cloud Service (I'm familiar with Google Cloud, but I may play around with Azure for the sake of remaining on the Microsoft platform)
- MongoDB (Might choose SQL Server later, but I know MongoDB is Free)

Anticipated Features:
- User Authentication using JWT Web Tokens
- Extensive list of mountains, pulled from an API, with searching and filtering features
- Challenge tracking, simply using our database
- Map Visualization of mountains and challenges
